      "The huamn brain is suppoby millions of neurons that help us comprehedn words and take actions. NLP uses artificial intelligence (AI) to give machine similar capabilities – allowing them to process spoken words, structure the information received, formulate an appropriate response, and reply in language that a user understands.\n",
      "For example, when you talk to a voice assistant such as an Amazon Alexa , it understands your words, your intentions , and (ideally) gives you the response you were looking for. Voice assistants, however, are just one example of NLP in our daily lives – some of the others might surprise you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Search engien use NLP to locate relevatn results based on similar search behaviors and user intent. For example , Google doesn’t just predict the popular searches that may apply to your question as you start typing. It looks at the whole picture and recognizes what you’re trying to say , rather than the exact search words – in other words , it searches what you probably meant to type , not necessarily what you actually typed.\n",
      "Email filters were one of the first applications of NLP , beginning with spam filters that would uncover given words or phrases that signaled a likely spam message. But that function has upgraded – one of the more prevalent , newer applications of NLP is found in Gmail’s email classification. The system recognizes whether an email belongs in the primary , social , or promotions category based on its contents , keeping your inbox manageable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Autocorrect and autocomplete are so much a part of our lives now that we take them for grante. Predictvie text is similar to a search engine in that it predicts things to say based on what you type, finishing the word or suggesting a relevant one. Autocorrect can even change words so that the overall message makes more sense. It also learns from you , customizing itself to your personal language quirks as you use it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tools using NLP are now able to scour customr interactions like social media comments, reviews, and brand name mentions to see what’s being said. An analysis of these interactions can help brands determine how well a marketing campaign is doing, monitor trending customer issues before they decide how to respond, and enhance service for a better customer experience.\n",
      "Smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa use voice recognition to recognize patterns in speech, infer meaning, and provide a useful response. We now expect assistants to understand contextual clues as they improve our lives and make activities like ordering items easier, and we’ve even gotten used to them responding humorously or answering questions about themselves. Our interactions with them will only grow more personal as technology improves and these assistants get to know more about us.\n",
      "There are over , spoken languages on the planet. Many of them don’t allow for straight translation and have different orders for sentence structure, which poor translations often overlooked. With NLP, online translators can translate languages more accurately and present grammatically correct results. Not only that, but when translating from another language to your own, tools can now recognize the language based on text input and translate it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our founding in , we have championed the value of human translation – and we still do. That’s why we’ve created and perfected a hybrid approach that involves leveraging multiple machine translation options and combining them with linguistic talent from around the globe. Our aim is always to produce a final text that reads as though it was done from start to finish by a human translator, and recent advances in technology such as NLP are making it easier to get there faster and at lower cost to our clients.\n",
      "\n",
      "In , the notorious mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing created what we now know as the “Turing Test”, which states that if a machine can have a conversation with a human and make them believe that they are actually speaking to another human, that machine is artificially intelligent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to , and computers are beating chess champions, deepfake videos are indistinguishable from the real thing, and the gamification of memory is a part of the world we live in. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is making existing translation technology more effective, a process that will only gather speed as the technology becomes more intelligent.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are multiple components in the AI-driven machine learning process, but three you probably hear about a lot are natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG). Because they’re all part of the process of reproducing human communication in computers, these terms are often confused. Let’s take a closer look at what they mean.\n"

It also learns from you , customizing itself to your personal language quirks as you use it.\\n', '\\n', 'Tools using NLP are now able to scour customr interactions like social media comments, reviews, and brand name mentions to see what’s being said. An analysis of these interactions can help brands determine how well a marketing campaign is doing, monitor trending customer issues before they decide how to respond, and enhance service for a better customer experience.\\n', 'Smart assistants like Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa use voice recognition to recognize patterns in speech, infer meaning, and provide a useful response. We now expect assistants to understand contextual clues as they improve our lives and make activities like ordering items easier, and we’ve even gotten used to them responding humorously or answering questions about themselves. Our interactions with them will only grow more personal as technology improves and these assistants get to know more about us.\\n', 'There are over 7,000 spoken languages on the planet. Many of them don’t allow for straight translation and have different orders for sentence structure, which poor translations often overlooked. With NLP, online translators can translate languages more accurately and present grammatically correct results. Not only that, but when translating from another language to your own, tools can now recognize the language based on text input and translate it.\\n', '\\n', 'Since our founding in 1996, we have championed the value of human translation – and we still do. That’s why we’ve created and perfected a hybrid approach that involves leveraging multiple machine translation options and combining them with linguistic talent from around the globe. Our aim is always to produce a final text that reads as though it was done from start to finish by a human translator, and recent advances in technology such as NLP are making it easier to get there faster and at lower cost to our clients.\\n', '\\n', 'In 1950, the notorious mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing created what we now know as the “Turing Test”, which states that if a machine can have a conversation with a human and make them believe that they are actually speaking to another human, that machine is artificially intelligent.\\n', '\\n', 'Fast forward to 2021, and computers are beating chess champions, deepfake videos are indistinguishable from the real thing, and the gamification of memory is a part of the world we live in. At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) is making existing translation technology more effective, a process that will only gather speed as the technology becomes more intelligent.\\n', '\\n', 'There are multiple components in the AI-driven machine learning process, but three you probably hear about a lot are natural language processing (NLP), natural language understanding (NLU), and natural language generation (NLG). Because they’re all part of the process of reproducing human communication in computers, these terms are often confused. Let’s take a closer look at what they mean.']\n"
